## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 31st Frontend Mentor Challenge.

I completed a Frontend Mentor challenge focused on creating a sign-up form. This project tested my skills in basic form structure, validation, and submission. Additionally, it provided an excellent opportunity to work with DOM manipulation through the success state. It was a comprehensive exercise that enhanced my proficiency in handling form-related tasks in web development.

**Had fun building it !** ðŸš€
